# Introduction

LLM Boilerplate is a file-driven specification system for LLM-assisted development.

## What is it?

A system that allows teams to define their project specs using simple files (TOML/Markdown) and automatically generates a browsable documentation portal with a working React prototype. Optimized for AI-assisted workflows.

## Key Concepts

- **Layers** - Structured TOML files defining guards, roles, routes, etc.
- **Docs** - Markdown documentation (you're reading one now)
- **Prototype** - Working React components linked to documentation
